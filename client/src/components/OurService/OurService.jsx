              Freeze-drying is the process of freeze-drying fruit. The fruit is first deep-frozen and then dried at a lower pressure, where the water from the fruit turns into steam and the fruit retains its natural structure, color, aroma and especially its nutritional value, including all vitamins and minerals contained in fresh fruit.
